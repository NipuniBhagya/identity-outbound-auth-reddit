## Reddit Authenticator
The Reddit authenticator is configured as a federated authenticator in WSO2 Identity Server to authenticate Reddit users to log in to your organizationâ€™s applications. Reddit is a platform for creating communities and is made up of thousands of active communities (known as "subreddits"), which are devoted to all sorts of different topics and are created and maintained by regular users. The diagram below illustrates the flow of the Reddit federated authenticator.
